PROBLEMS WITH MALAYSIA:

Purchasing Peltsat with culture doesn't work:  Runtime Error: C:\Users\Christopher\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\MODS\[BNW] Colonialist Legacies - Malaysia (v 2)\Lua/CL_Malaysia_Functions.lua:153: attempt to index field 'BGBlock' (a nil value) FIXED

Kaumpangs can be built even without resources; change to being built on resources/atolls? FIXED - Instead the worker is killed

Workers can upgrade regardless of enemy units FIXED

Admiral decision will become availiable just for having two trade units; Cargo Ships may then be counted as a naval unit. FIXED

Reduce culture - half it? FIXED - Seems more balanced

Their CulDiv soundtrack is updated to... Central? Hm... FIXED

Noticed an odd issue where the UA food bonus was being given by resources outside the borders - but I really don't know why... FIXED - Issue with code

Culture from food text is really hard to read FIXED - Unified into one single message each turn

Food from Naval is really hard to read FIXED - Now in MCIS

Food from Naval isn't actually added to culture FIXED

Move Food from Naval back to PlayerDoTurn, but move it above Culture still. FIXED... Probably. Can't really remember what this issue was...
