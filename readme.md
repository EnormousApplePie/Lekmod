## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- **LEKMOD/Lekmap not showing in multiplayer lobby**: Ensure that you have copied the files to the correct DLC folder. The final path should be as shown in the installation instructions. eg.: `...\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC\LEKMODvXX_X\` / `...\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\Maps\Lekmap vX_X\`
- **UI issues**: If you are using EUI, ensure you are using a supported version (v1.29 and higher is NOT SUPPORTED). Run the ui_check.bat (Windows) or linux_ui_check.sh (Linux) to ensure the correct UI files are in place.


If you encounter any issues during installation or gameplay, you can refer to the LEKMOD Discord server for assistance. Check the install-troubleshooting channel.
